The sea-scape resembles lichen twisting and
turning for a thousand li.
There is no shore to land and it is difficult to
walk.
With a gentle breeze I arrived at the city
thinking all would be so.
At ease, how was one to know he was to live in a
wooden building?

Because my house had bare walls, I began
rushing all about.
The waves are happy, laughing "Ha-ha!"
When I arrived on Island, I heard I was
forbidden to land.
I could do nothing but frown and feel angry
at heaven.

As a rule, a person is twenty before he starts
making a living.
Family circumstances have forced me to
experience wind and dust.
The heartless months and years seem bent on
defeating me.
It is a pity that time quickly ages one.

The gold and silver of America is very
appealing.
Jabbing an awl into the thigh" in search of
glory,
I embarked on the journey.
Not only are my one-thousand pieces of gold
already depleted, but
My countenance is blackened. It is surely for
the sake of the family.

Four days before the Qiqiao Festival,
I boarded the steamship for America.
Time flew like a shooting arrow.
Already, a cool autumn has passed.
Counting on my fingers, several months have
elapsed.
Still I am at the beginning of the road.
I have yet to be interrogated.
My heart is nervous with anticipation.

Everyone says travelling to North America is
a pleasure.
I suffered misery on the ship and sadness in
the wooden building.
After several interrogations, still I am not
done.
I sigh because my compatriots are being
forceably detained.

Originally, I had intended to come to
America last year.
Lack of money delayed me until early
autumn.
It was on the day that the Weaver Maiden
met the Cowherd
That I took passage on the President Lincoln.
I ate wind and tasted waves for more than
twenty days.
Fortunately, I arrived safely on the American
continent.
I thought I could land in a few days.
How was I to know I would become a
prisoner suffering in the wooden building?
The barbarians' abuse is really difficult to
take.
When my family's circumstances stir my
emotions, a double stream of tears flow.
I only wish I can land in San Francisco soon.
Thus sparing me this additional sorrow here.

Instead of remaining a citizen of China, I
willingly became an ox.
I intended to come to America to earn a
living.
The Western styled buildings are lofty; but I
have not the luck to live in them.
How was anyone to know that my dwelling
place would be a prison?

I used to admire the land of the Flowery
Flag as a country of abundance.
I immediately raised money and started my
journey.
For over a month, I have experienced enough
winds and waves.
Now on an extended sojourn in jail, I am
subject to the ordeals of prison life.
I look up and see Oakland so close by.
I wish to go back to my motherland to carry
the farmer's hoe.
Discontent fills my belly and it is difficult for
me to sleep.
I just write these few lines to express what is
on my mind.

Just talk about going to the land of the
Flowery Flag and my countenance fills
with happiness.
Not without hard work were 1,000 pieces of
gold dug up and gathered together.
There were words of farewell to the parents,
but the throat choked up first.
There were many feelings, many tears flowing
face to face, when parting with the wife.
Waves big as mountains often astonished this
traveller.
With laws harsh as tigers, I had a taste of all
the barbarities.
Do not forget this day when you land ashore.
Push yourself ahead and do not be lazy or
idle.

I think back on the past when I had not
experienced hardship.
I resolved to go and seek Taogong.
The months and years are wasted and still it
has not ended.
Up to now, I am still trapped on a lonely
island.

Today is the last day of winter.
Tomorrow morning is the vernal equinox.
One year's prospects have changed to another.
Sadness kills the person in the wooden
building.

Random Thoughts Deep at Night
In the quiet of night, I heard, faintly, the
whistling of wind.
The forms and shadows saddened me, upon
seeing the landscape, I composed a poem.
The floating clouds, the fog, darken the sky.
The moon shines faintly as the insects chirp.
Grief and bitterness entwined are heaven sent.
The sad person sits alone, leaning by a window.

Random Thoughts at Mid-Autumn Festival
The night is cool as I lie stiff on the steel bunk.
Before the window the moon lady shines on me.
Bored, I get up and stand beneath the cold
window.
Sadly, I count the time that's elapsed.
It is already mid-autumn.
We should all honor and enjoy her.
But I have not prepared even the most trifling
gift and I feel embarrassed.

The insects chirp outside the four walls.
The inmates often sigh.
Thinking of affairs back home.
Unconscious tears wet my lapel.

Depressed from living on Island, I sought the
Sleeping Village.
The uncertain future altogether wounds my
spirit.
When I see my old country fraught with chaos,
I, a drifting leaf, become doubly saddened.

My belly is so full of discontent it is really
difficult to relax.
I can only worry silently to myself.
At times I gaze at the cloud- and fog-enshrouded
mountain-front.
It only deepens my sadness.

Sadly, I listen to the sounds of insects and
angry surf.
The harsh laws pile layer upon layer; how
can I dissipate my hatred?
Drifting in as a traveller, I met with this
calamity.
It is more miserable than owning only a flute
in the marketplace of Wu.

Living on Island away from home elicits a
hundred feelings.
My chest is filled with a sadness and anger I
cannot bear to explain.
Night and day, I sit passively and listlessly.
Fortunately, I have a novel as my companion.

Imprisonment at Youli, when will it end?
Fur and linen garments have been exchanged;
it is already another autumn.
My belly brims with discontent, too numerous
to inscribe on bamboo slips.
Snow falls, flowers wilt, expressing sorrow
through the ages.

The west wind ruffles my thin gauze clothing.
On the hill sits a tall building with a room of
wooden planks.
I wish I could travel on a cloud far away,
reunite with my wife and son.
When the moonlight shines on me alone, the
nights seem even longer.
At the head of the bed there is wine and my
heart is constantly drunk.
There is no flower beneath my pillow and
my dreams are not sweet.
To whom can I confide my innermost
feelings?
I rely solely on close friends to relieve my
loneliness.

America has power, but not justice.
In prison, we were victimized as if we were
guilty.
Given no opportunity to explain, it was really
brutal.
I bow my head in reflection but there is
nothing I can do.

This place is called an island of immortals.
When, in fact, this mountain wilderness is a
prison.
Once you see the open net, why throw
yourself in?
It is only because of empty pockets I can do
nothing else.

I, a seven foot man, am ashamed I cannot
extend myself.
Curled up in an enclosure, my movements
are dictated by others.
Enduring a hundred humiliations, I can only
cry in vain.
This person's tears fall, but what can the blue
heavens do?

I have infinite feelings that the ocean
has changed into a mulberry grove.
My body is detained in this building.
I cannot fly from this grassy hill.
And green waters block the hero.
Impetuously, I threw away my writing brush.
My efforts have all been in vain.
It is up to me to answer carefully.
I have no words to murmur against the east
wind.
