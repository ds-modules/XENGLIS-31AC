The sea-scape resembles lichen twisting and
turning for a thousand li
There is no shore to land and it is difficult to
walk.
With a gentle breeze I arrived at the city
thinking all would be so.
At ease, how was one to know he was to live in a
wooden building?

Because my house had bare walls, I began
rushing all about.
The waves are happy, laughing "Ha-ha!"
When I arrived on Island, I heard I was
forbidden to land.
I could do nothing but frown and feel angry
at heaven.

As a rule, a person is twenty before he starts
making a living.
Family circumstances have forced me to
experience wind and dust.
The heartless months and years seem bent on
defeating me.
It is a pity that time quickly ages one.

The gold and silver of America is very
appealing.
Jabbing an awl into the thigh in search of
glory,
I embarked on the journey.
Not only are my one-thousand pieces of gold
already depleted, but
My countenance is blackened. It is surely for
the sake of the family.

Four days before the Qiqiao Festival,
I boarded the steamship for America.
Time flew like a shooting arrow.
Already, a cool autumn has passed.
Counting on my fingers, several months have
elapsed.
Still I am at the beginning of the road.
I have yet to be interrogated.
My heart is nervous with anticipation.

Everyone says travelling to North America is
a pleasure.
I suffered misery on the ship and sadness in
the wooden building.
After several interrogations, still I am not
done.
I sigh because my compatriots are being
forceably detained.

Originally, I had intended to come to
America last year.
Lack of money delayed me until early
autumn.
It was on the day that the Weaver Maiden
met the Cowherd
That I took passage on the President Lincoln.
I ate wind and tasted waves for more than
twenty days.
Fortunately, I arrived safely on the American
continent.
I thought I could land in a few days.
How was I to know I would become a
prisoner suffering in the wooden building?
The barbarians' abuse is really difficult to
take.
When my family's circumstances stir my
emotions, a double stream of tears flow.
I only wish I can land in San Francisco soon.
Thus sparing me this additional sorrow here.

Instead of remaining a citizen of China, I
willingly became an ox.
I intended to come to America to earn a
living.
The Western styled buildings are lofty; but I
have not the luck to live in them.
How was anyone to know that my dwelling
place would be a prison?

I used to admire the land of the Flowery
Flag as a country of abundance.
I immediately raised money and started my
journey.
For over a month, I have experienced enough
winds and waves.
Now on an extended sojourn in jail, I am
subject to the ordeals of prison life.
I look up and see Oakland so close by.
I wish to go back to my motherland to carry
the farmer's hoe.
Discontent fills my belly and it is difficult for
me to sleep.
I just write these few lines to express what is
on my mind.

Just talk about going to the land of the
Flowery Flag and my countenance fills
with happiness.
Not without hard work were 1,000 pieces of
gold dug up and gathered together.
There were words of farewell to the parents,
but the throat choked up first.
There were many feelings, many tears flowing
face to face, when parting with the wife.
Waves big as mountains often astonished this
traveller.
With laws harsh as tigers, I had a taste of all
the barbarities.
Do not forget this day when you land ashore.
Push yourself ahead and do not be lazy or
idle.

I think back on the past when I had not
experienced hardship.
I resolved to go and seek Taogong.
The months and years are wasted and still it
has not ended.
Up to now, I am still trapped on a lonely
island.

Today is the last day of winter.
Tomorrow morning is the vernal equinox.
One year's prospects have changed to another.
Sadness kills the person in the wooden
building.

In the quiet of night, I heard, faintly, the
whistling of wind.
The forms and shadows saddened me, upon
seeing the landscape, I composed a poem.
The floating clouds, the fog, darken the sky.
The moon shines faintly as the insects chirp.
Grief and bitterness entwined are heaven sent.
The sad person sits alone, leaning by a window.

The night is cool as I lie stiff on the steel bunk.
Before the window the moon lady shines on me.
Bored, I get up and stand beneath the cold
window.
Sadly, I count the time that's elapsed.
It is already mid-autumn.
We should all honor and enjoy her.
But I have not prepared even the most trifling
gift and I feel embarrassed.

The insects chirp outside the four walls.
The inmates often sigh.
Thinking of affairs back home.
Unconscious tears wet my lapel.

Depressed from living on Island, I sought the
Sleeping Village.
The uncertain future altogether wounds my
spirit.
When I see my old country fraught with chaos,
I, a drifting leaf, become doubly saddened.

My belly is so full of discontent it is really
difficult to relax.
I can only worry silently to myself.
At times I gaze at the cloud- and fog-enshrouded
mountain-front.
It only deepens my sadness.

Sadly, I listen to the sounds of insects and
angry surf.
The harsh laws pile layer upon layer; how
can I dissipate my hatred?
Drifting in as a traveller, I met with this
calamity.
It is more miserable than owning only a flute
in the marketplace of Wu.

Living on Island away from home elicits a
hundred feelings.
My chest is filled with a sadness and anger I
cannot bear to explain.
Night and day, I sit passively and listlessly.
Fortunately, I have a novel as my companion.

Imprisonment at Youli, when will it end?
Fur and linen garments have been exchanged;
it is already another autumn.
My belly brims with discontent, too numerous
to inscribe on bamboo slips.
Snow falls, flowers wilt, expressing sorrow
through the ages.

The west wind ruffles my thin gauze clothing.
On the hill sits a tall building with a room of
wooden planks.
I wish I could travel on a cloud far away,
reunite with my wife and son.
When the moonlight shines on me alone, the
nights seem even longer.
At the head of the bed there is wine and my
heart is constantly drunk.
There is no flower beneath my pillow and
my dreams are not sweet.
To whom can I confide my innermost
feelings?
I rely solely on close friends to relieve my
loneliness.

America has power, but not justice.
In prison, we were victimized as if we were
guilty.
Given no opportunity to explain, it was really
brutal.
I bow my head in reflection but there is
nothing I can do.

This place is called an island of immortals.
When, in fact, this mountain wilderness is a
prison.
Once you see the open net, why throw
yourself in?
It is only because of empty pockets I can do
nothing else.

I, a seven foot man, am ashamed I cannot
extend myself.
Curled up in an enclosure, my movements
are dictated by others."
Enduring a hundred humiliations, I can only
cry in vain.
This person's tears fall, but what can the blue
heavens do?

I have infinite feelings that the ocean
has changed into a mulberry grove.
My body is detained in this building.
I cannot fly from this grassy hill.
And green waters block the hero.
Impetuously, I threw away my writing brush.
My efforts have all been in vain.
It is up to me to answer carefully.
I have no words to murmur against the east
wind.

My grief, like dense clouds, cannot be
dispersed.
Whether deliberating or being melancholy
and bored,
I constantly pace to and fro.
Wang Can ascended the tower but who
pitied his sorrow?
Lord Yu who left his country could only wail
to himself.

Over a hundred poems are on the walls.
Looking at them, they are all pining at the
delayed progress.
What can one sad person say to another?
Unfortunate travellers everywhere wish to
commiserate.
Gain or lose, how is one to know what is
predestined?
Rich or poor, who is to say it is not the will
of heaven?
Why should one complain if he is detained
and imprisoned here?
From ancient times, heroes often were the
first ones to face adversity.

The male eagle is also easy to tame.
One must be able to bend before one can
stretch.
China experienced calamities for a thousand
years.
Confucius was surrounded in Chen for seven
days.
Great men exhibit quality.
Scholars take pride in being themselves.
Gains and losses are entangled in my bosom.
My restlessness is a sign of self-illumination.

Half way up the hill on Island, in the
building upstairs.
The imprisoned one has been separated from
his people summer to autumn.
Three times I dreamed of returning to the
native village.
My intestines are agitated in its nine turns by
the false Westerner.
I have run into hard times and am uselessly
depressed.
There are many obstacles in life but who will
commiserate with me?
If at a later time I am allowed to land on the
American shore,
I will toss all the miseries of this jail to the
flowing current.

After leaping into prison, I cannot come out.
From endless sorrows, tears and blood streak.
The jingwei bird carries gravel to fill its old
grudge.
The migrating wild goose complains to the
moon, mourning his harried life.
When Ziqing was in distant lands, who
pitied and inquired after him?
When Ruan Ji reached the end of the road,
he shed tile tears.
The scented grass and hidden orchids
complain of withering and falling.
When can I be allowed to rise above as I
please?

There are tens of thousands of poems
composed on these walls.
They are all cries of complaint and sadness.
The day I am rid of this prison and attain
success,
I must remember that this chapter once
existed.
In my daily needs, I must be frugal.
Needless extravagance leads youth to ruin.
All my compatriots should please be mindful.
Once you have some small gains, return
home early.

Imprisoned in the wooden building day after
day.
My freedom withheld; how can I bear to talk
about it?
I look to see who is happy but they only sit
quietly.
I am anxious and depressed and cannot fall
asleep.
The days are long and the bottle constantly
empty; my sad mood, even so, is not
dispelled.
Nights are long and the pillow cold; who can
pity my loneliness?
After experiencing such loneliness and sorrow.
Why not just return home and learn to plow
the fields?

A building does not have to be tall; if it has
windows, it will be bright.
Island is not far, Angel Island.
Alas, this wooden building disrupts my
travelling schedule.
Paint on the four walls are green.
And green is the grass which surrounds.
It is noisy because of the many country folk.
And there are watchmen guarding during the
night.
To exert influence, one can use a square-holed
elder brother.
There are children who disturb the ears.
But there are no incoherent sounds that
cause fatigue.
I gaze to the south at the hospital,
And look to the west at the army camp.
This author says, "What happiness is there in
this?

For what reason must I sit in jail?
It is only because my country is weak and
my family poor.
My parents wait at the door but there is no
news.
My wife and child wrap themselves in quilt,
sighing with loneliness.
Even if my petition is approved and I can
enter the country.
When can I return to the Mountains of Tang
with a full load?
From ancient times, those who venture out
usually become worthless.
How many people ever return from battles?


Leaving behind my writing brush and
removing my sword, I came to America.
Who was to know two streams of tears would
flow upon arriving here?
If there comes a day when I will have
attained my ambition and become
successful,
I will certainly behead the barbarians and
spare not a single blade of grass.

I am a member of the Huang clan from
Xiangcheng.
I threw away my writing brush and pushed
forward, journeying to the capital of the
U.S.
I bought an oar and arrived in the land of the
Golden Mountain.
Who was to know they would banish me to
Island?
If my country had contrived to make herself
strong, this never would have happened.
Then when the ship had docked, we could
have gone directly ashore.

Just now the five nationalities in China have
become one family,
But the powers still have not yet recognized
our China,
Primarily because foreign debts were piling
up.
The foreigners pushed to control finances
and to seize power.

Being idle in the wooden building, I opened
a window.
The morning breeze and bright moon lingered
together.
I reminisce the native village far away, cut off
by clouds and mountains.
On the little island the wailing of cold, wild
geese can be faintly heard.
The hero who has lost his way can talk
meaninglessly of the sword.
The poet at the end of the road can only
ascend a tower.
One should know that when the country is
weak, the people's spirit dies.
Why else do we come to this place to be
imprisoned?

Twice I have passed through the blue ocean,
experienced the wind and dust of journey.
Confinement in the wooden building has
pained me doubly.
With a weak country, we must all join
together in urgent effort.
It depends on all of us together to roll back
the wild wave.

I lean on the railing and lift my head to look
at the cloudy sky.
All the mountains and rivers are dark.
Eastern Mongolia is lost and the date of her
return is uncertain.
The recovery of the Central Plains depends
on the youth.
Only the tongue of Changshan can slay the
villainous.
To kill the bandit we must wave the whip of
Zu Di.
I am ashamed to be curled up like a worm
on Island.
I grieve for my native land but what else can
I say?

I have ten-thousand hopes that the
revolutionary armies will complete their
victory.
And help make the mining enterprises
successful in the ancestral land.
They will build many battleships and come to
the U.S. territory.
Vowing never to stop till the white men are
completely annihilated.

The dragon out of water is humiliated by
ants;
The fierce tiger who is caged is baited by a
child.
As long as I am imprisoned, how can I dare
strive for supremacy?
An advantageous position for revenge will
surely come one day.

I left the village well behind me, bade
farewell to my father and mother.
Now I gaze at distant clouds and mountains,
tears forming like pearls.
The wandering son longed to be wealthy like
Taozhu.
Who would have known I would be
imprisoned on Island?
I beat my breast when I think of China and
cry bitterly like Ruan Ji.
Our country's wealth is being drained by
foreigners, causing us to suffer national
humiliations.
My fellow countrymen, have foresight, plan
to be resolute.
And vow to conquer the U.S. and avenge
previous wrongs!

If the land of the Flowery Flag is occupied by
us in turn.
The wooden building will be left for the
angel's revenge.

If you have but one breath left, do not be
discouraged from your purpose.
I respectfully exhort my brothers who are all
talents of Chu.
Having a sense of shame, one can eradicate
shame.
Only by wielding the lance can one avoid
certain defeat.
Do not say that we have not the means to
level the ugly barbarians.
I am searching for a method that will turn
destiny back.
One-hundred-thousand men sharpen their
swords.
Swearing to behead the Loulan and open
the grasslands and fallow fields.

The low building with three beams merely
shelters the body.
It is unbearable to relate the stories
accumulated on the Island slopes.
Wait till the day I become successful and
fulfill my wish!
I will not speak of love when I level the
immigration station!

I am distressed that we Chinese are detained
in this wooden building.
It is actually racial barriers which cause
difficulties on Yingtai Island.
Even while they are tyrannical, they still
claim to be humanitarian.
I should regret my taking the risks of coming
in the first place.

I thoroughly hate the barbarians because they
do not respect justice.
They continually promulgate harsh laws to
show off their prowess.
They oppress the overseas Chinese and also
violate treaties.
They examine for hookworms and practice
hundreds of despotic acts.

I cannot bear to describe the harsh treatment
by the doctors.
Being stabbed for blood samples and
examined for hookworms was even more
pitiful.
After taking the medicine, I also drank
liquid,
Like a dumb person eating the huanglian.
